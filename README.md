# sumDigits

Hello everyone!

I've created a simple program in Java that calculates all digits in your number. 


<i> The program functions as follows: </i><br>
In a while-loop the least significant digits are extracted and then discarted. All extracted digits will 
be summed up after the while-loop. This sum will be passed to the Main method.
You can look at the detailed comments in my code.


Have fun!
